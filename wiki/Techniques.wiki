#summary Advantages and Disadvantages of Graph Drawing Techniques

= Advantages and Disadvantages =

== Planarization Techniques ==
<p>
*Pro:*<br />
+ fast running time<br />
+ applicable to straight-line, orthogonal and polyline drawings<br />
+ supported by theoretical results on planar drawings<br />
+ works well in practice, also for large graphs<br />
+ limted constraint satisfaction capability<br />
</p>
<p>
*Con:*<br />
- relatively complex to implement<br />
- topological transformations may alter the user’s mental map<br />
- difficult to extend to 3D<br />
- limted constraint satisfaction capability<br />
</p>
== Force-Directed Techniques ==
<p>
*Pro:*<br />
+ relatively simple to implement<br />
+ heuristic improvements easily added<br />
+ smooth evolution of the drawing into the final configuration helps preserving the user’s mental map<br />
+ can be extended to 3D<br />
+ often able to detect and display symmetries<br />
+ works well in practice for small graphs with regular structure<br />
+ limted constraint satisfaction capability<br />
</p>
<p>
*Con:<br />*
- slow running time<br />
- few theoretical results on the quality of the drawings produced<br />
- diffcult to extend to orthogonal and polyline drawings<br />
- limited constraint satisfaction capability<br />
