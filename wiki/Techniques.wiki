*Planarization Techniques*
Pro:
+ fast running time
+ applicable to straight-line, orthogonal and polyline drawings
+ supported by theoretical results on planar drawings
+ works well in practice, also for large graphs
+ limted constraint satisfaction capability
Con:
- relatively complex to implement
- topological transformations may alter the user’s mental map
- difficult to extend to 3D
- limted constraint satisfaction capability

*Force-Directed Techniques*
Pro:
+ relatively simple to implement
+ heuristic improvements easily added
+ smooth evolution of the drawing into the final configuration helps preserving the user’s mental map
+ can be extended to 3D
+ often able to detect and display symmetries
+ works well in practice for small graphs with regular structure
+ limted constraint satisfaction capability
Con:
- slow running time
- few theoretical results on the quality of the drawings produced
- diffcult to extend to orthogonal and polyline drawings
- limited constraint satisfaction capability
